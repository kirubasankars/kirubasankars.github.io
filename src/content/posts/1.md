I like computer and music. I like food.

I love my kids.

And I like to play Call of Duty.

A screencast is a digital video recording of a computer screen while someone is using it, and usually includes audio narration. A course based on screencasts will have the instructor recording their screen while they run through presentation slides, terminal commands, setting up a development environment, writing code in an editor, running code, etc.

Typically these will be broken down into smaller sections rather than one massive recording. When taking the course, you can select which video to watch, then use the video player controls to pause, go forward, go back, speed up and so on. There is no time limit to complete the course, and no one is taking attendance.
